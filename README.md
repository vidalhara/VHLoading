## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate VHLoading into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'VHLoading', '~> 1.0.0'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate VHLoading into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "vidalhara/VHLoading" ~> 1.0
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding VHLoading as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/vidalhara/VHLoading", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## Example

You can find the example usages of framework in the VHLoadingExample [project](./VHLoadingExample/VHLoadingExample.xcodeproj).
